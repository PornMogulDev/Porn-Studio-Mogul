Here the player can book shooting blocs, either by double-clicking a week header (which will set the planned week to the header clicked, but can be changed), or by clicking the button. 

Not much to say here. I feel like the weekly is a good middle point between gameplay possibilities and ease of implementation at the moment, but the (very long term) plan is to move to a daily schedule.
