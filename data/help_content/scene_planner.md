The Scene Planner is where you design the content you will shoot and the number of performers that will appear, as well as some of their attributes, which will determine their elegibility for Assigned Tags and Action Segments' roles.\\n\\nTheir Disposition selection is only relevant (and available) when the scene has a Dom/sub dynamic at play, and will make the Talent's Dom (if in a Dominant disposition), Sub (if in a Submissive disposition), or both (if in a Switch disposition) skills contribute to the Action tags quality.\\n\\nRegardless of the type, all tags have a (hidden, but hopefully intuitive) Appeal Weight. This determines their importance when it comes to calculating the Scene Appeal for a Viewer Group. They could a value chosen by the player, but I believe that it makes more sense like this; for example, raceplay will have a large impact in the viewer's perception, as well as one involving watersports, no matter how 'little' of the total runtime of a scene it might take up. While the fact that a scene has vaginal penetration won't matter much to most viewers.\\n\\nThere are two types of Global Tags: Global and Assigned. Global influence everything about a scene. For example, selecting the 'Fishnets' tags doesn't just mean that some Performer is wearing fishnets (that's why it isn't an Assigned tag), maybe at some point there will be a more detailed wardrobe system where you can choose what everyone is wearing for the scene, but for the moment, the 'Fishnets' tag implies that fishnets are a focal point of the scene; the camera lingers on them, Performers caress them, they stick their dick thru the holes, etc."
