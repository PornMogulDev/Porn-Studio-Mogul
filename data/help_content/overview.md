At some point, this will be a sort of game manual. Right now, while it will still somewhat function as that, my goal is for it to be a place where I put my thoughts on the current development, both to help me flesh out my own ideas and to help with discussions and providing feedback on the design of the game.



In several places around the interface, there are Help buttons like the one you've clicked to open this, with the appropriate topic highlighted. You can also navigate this menu, as there are some entries without their own button.
