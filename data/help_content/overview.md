At some point, this will be a sort of game manual. Right now, while it will still somewhat function as that, my goal is for it to be a place where I put my thoughts on the current development, both to help me flesh out my own ideas and to help with discussions and providing feedback on the design of the game.



For this update, I am feeling a bit down. I don't want to expand too much what is already in the game in case it will get changed soon, but also feels like I am adding incomplete stuff on top of incomplete stuff.



I've finished what I'm going to have for this update when it comes to this Help thing, and I think that while it would actually be good to have the manual part, the 'devlog' part isn't too useful and it might be better to actually write a weekly or bi-weekly thing about what I've tried to implement, why and how.
