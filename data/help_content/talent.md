The Talent is possibly the most central part of the game's design. They must feel distinct and believable enough for the emergent narratives to be satisfying.

At the moment, they don't fulfil either obligation very well. Their skills and attributes are quite limited to have much specialization, but I don't want to go overboard with adding more precise skills or physical attributes, and instead introduce them gradually, making sure that they all interact with the appropriate tags, events, etc, and have a distinct function in the game's loop.

Still, the next implementations I am planning are both for them: relationships (between themselves and with studios), and an actual nationality system that interacts with the naming system and that allows for a deeper system when it comes to hiring thanks to a "based off location" feature, more on that in the hiring section of Help.



**The Details**

These are the general info about the character.

* The only two genders presently in the game are Male and Female. There should be trans talent at some point, and I don't think the implementation will be too painful due to how the relevant stuff works in the game.
* Alias, and not their 'real' name, which should be a thing at some point. Not much to say, its generation should improve with time, as well as allowing the player to give talent a custom alias for their productions, if they accept. If you see a name that shouldn't be in the generation pool for being too specific to someone IRL, let me know.
* Age doesn't do much other than determine the talent's age affinities, which influence what age tags they are good at 'representing', and which viewer groups will like them more. Down the line, it should affect skill gain and loss, and then many other things like death probability.
* Ethnicity is a hodgepodge of porn ethnicities (pornicities, if you like) and nationalities meant to represent 'sexualized populations' that the viewer groups can have preferences for (as well as for particular interracial pairings). The four main porn ethnicities plus actual nationalities is probably how this is going to end up.
* Orientation is a range from -100 (completely straight) to 100 (completely gay). It determines the preferences and demands for tag orientations. It could be some requirement for certain events and it would also have an effect on potential romantic relationships between the characters and stuff like that.
* The only physical descriptors are dick and cup size, one for male and the other for female talent. As Age, they determine physical affinities and are requirements for some events. I think physical descriptors should be greatly expanded and probably be dependant on ethnicity/nationality. Not a priority at the moment as, while it would provide both distinction between talent and (if done well) a higher degree of plausibility, they would interact with the preferences system, which isn't properly prepared at the moment with what it has to handle.
* Popularity, divided by viewer group, means how well known they are in the porn world. It goes up when the talent participates in scenes and decreases with time. Events, like crossovers into the 'mainstream' world, could influence it and have it as a requirement too.



At this time, they are all fixed except for Age and Popularity.



**The Skills**

At this time, the only skills are Performance, Acting, Stamina, and Dom/Sub.



* Performance basically represents the 'sexual prowess' of the talent. By default, it is the main skill tested during Action Segments and could be a requirement for some events. With time, it is either going to be completely substituted by, or completely made off sub-skills, representing a more granular aspects of this. For example, Oral, some penetrative skill, some receiving skill, etc. I don't feel this is a very pressing matter.
* Acting is to represent the thespian side of a porn production. By default, much less important than the other skill in determining the quality of Action Segments, it could also be used in events, and in some future addition where talent can come from and go to different occupations, it could make so more believable. I don't see this one getting more granular, but it is also a possibility.
* Stamina determines the runtime, influenced also by the type of tags, that a talent can participate in before getting tired, and so their performance being penalized in that (whole) scene. If a talent does go over that threshold, it also becomes Fatigued, which is the only 'status effect' present in the game at this point and will make them perform worse while it lasts. It will last more, and have higher penalties, the more it is pushed and the talent isn't allowed to rest. Obviously, the talent should know about this and start rejecting bookings if they are fatigued, but they don't at the moment.
* Dom/Sub skills are admittedly already an specialization of the Performance and Acting skills. Mechanically, it acts as a completely separate operation, where they only come into play when the scene has a Dom/sub dynamic, splitting the quality calculation with the other two (having a higher weight the stronger the dynamic is). These don't have anything to do with a talent's disposition and preference for dominance or submissiveness.



At the moment, they can only go up, and they will depending on how much they are tested in a scene. I.e. a 60 minute scene with more demanding action tags will make the participating talent gain more Stamina than a 10 minute one.



**The Personality**

This aspect is determined by a couple of details at the moment: Personality Attributes, Archetypes, and Disposition.



* Personality Attributes are characteristics that range 1-100 meant to shape a talent's behaviour and attitudes. At the moment, only Professionalism and Ambition exist. Professionalism affects how likely a talent is to be the trigger of bad events in an inverse correlation, while high Ambition will make a talent demand a higher salary and gain skills at a faster pace.
* Both also have a hand in determining what Archetype a talent will be generated with. They set the talent's policy requirements and refusals, as well as, together with their Orientation and Disposition scores, their likes, dislikes, and limits; the Archetype will set if a talent likes or dislikes Anal, their Orientation score will determine with whom they like and dislike it more, and their Disposition what role they prefer to perform in it.
* Disposition is similar to Orientation, goes from -100 (complete submissive), to 100 (complete dominant), and at the moment, is only used to determine role preferences as stated above. It has nothing to do with a talent's skill at playing a Dom or sub in a scene.



Hard limits should also take into account the role, probably.
