At this point, the only 'contract modality' at play is a per scene one. By multi-selecting (shift + left click) several roles in the hiring section, talent can be hired for several roles at the same time, as long as those roles are for different scenes. Realistically, a talent could perform several roles in the same scene, but this is so rare and it would be such a headache to implement, that I don't think it is worth it.



**Hiring**

For every role, the performer name, the action tags and the talent's demand are visible at a glance.

A role might not appear for a talent, which means that they don't fulfil its gender and/or ethnicity requirements.

It might appear, but be greyed-out, which means that they fulfil said requirements, but aren't willing to perform that role for whatever reason (usually accurately reported by a tooltip). These reasons might be some tag being a hard limit for them, them disliking the tag too much, usually because of an orientation mismatch, the on-set policies not matching their requirements for those, or certain production settings being too low for their standards.



**Demand**

The total demand that a talent has for a certain role is determined as follows: (balancing number \* performance skill multiplier \* ambition multiplier \* popularity multiplier \* role multiplier) / preference multiplier

The Performance multiplier should probably be an Acting + Performance multiplier, perhaps including a Dom/Sub skill multiplier, depending on if the scene has a D/s dynamic, maybe not.

Ambition and Popularity multipliers are self-explanatory, the highest a talent's Ambition or Popularity, the more money they will ask for. Perhaps the Popularity one could be more granular, with some talent willing having a lower demand for scenes focused on groups with whom they have a lower Popularity. And perhaps, not completely related to this, some talent refusing to work on scenes that focused on certain groups.

Every Action tag has a 'demand multiplier', with the highest one from the ones that the role is composed of being the only one taken into account for this. I should probably add these multipliers to Thematic and Physical tags too.

Finally, the preference multiplier averages the preference of the talent for everything the would have to perform in the scene, with a high average preference leading to a lower demand, and otherwise.



**In the Future**

There are no penalties (i.e. a talent demanding a higher salary) for hirings made very close to the date of the shoot, and I believe there should be. 

Related to this, the 'based off location' system would make it so 'local' (relative to the player's studio) talent would be cheaper than 'national' and 'international' based talent, accounting for travel expenses and the talent's willingness to move there for bookings. Which would be alleviated by the talent doing 'tours', or even the player's studio giving talent several bookings that happen close to each other in time (i.e. in a couple of consecutive weeks).



Additionally, there will also be another type of contract with 'exclusive' ones, where the length in time, number and content of scenes is agreed on,  the talent is paid a weekly salary, and they can't work for other studios.
