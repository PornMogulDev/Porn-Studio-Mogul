The Shooting Bloc is meant to simulate the fact that studios usually hire a crew, a location, equipment, etc to shoot a bunch of scenes. Realistically, also performers, and this might be a thing once the 'based off location' system is implemented.

Right now, there is no maximum number of shooting blocs that you can book for a week. There should probably be, once I figure out how the player avatar will function. I am leaning towards individual producer with some fatigue or stress system. Perhaps, once I implement an AI, it would also be possible to hire extra producers for the studio that can create scenes.



The only effects that most of these settings have right now are some extra hiring checks, a multiplier to the quality of every tag in the scene, and a modification to the probability of 'good' and 'bad' events, as well as acting as requirements and restrictions for individual events.

The number of cameras has an extra function, as it interacts with the editing in post-production: many cameras and poor editing give a malus, many cameras and good editing give a big bonus, etc. Down the line, I intend to implement a way for the player to be able to release different 'camera angle' versions of scenes, I imagine at the same time that options for cameramen and directors, maybe in relation with how POV scenes will work. I have to think about this.



The implementation is shaky at the moment, as the cost of the settings is fixed per scene, but many (catering, wardrobe, and makeup, at the moment) should realistically take into account the number of performers. But it can't because it still doesn't know that information and it subtracts the money when the bloc is planned, not after the shots, which I think makes sense and wouldn't want to change in principle, but also having the player plan for the number of performers at this point feels like too rigid a system.



Something on even shakier ground right now are the on-set policies. Perhaps this shouldn't even be here and should be a global setting of the studio.
