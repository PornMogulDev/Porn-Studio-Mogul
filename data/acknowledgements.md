This game would not be possible without the existence of many free and open-source resources, tools, and components. For example: 
I am using Nuitka for compiling. PyQt6 is the interface framework. SQLAlchemy is used for data handling. dataclasses-json for the live management of the game session. numpy for numerical computations. It also uses themes from PyQtDarkTheme.
More comprehensive attributions for these and other components are available at <a href='file:NOTICE.md'>NOTICE.md</a> and <a href='file:THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md'>THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md</a>.

As someone who doesn't know anything about videogame development or coding, I am making extensive use of AI (mainly Google's AI Studio) for every step of development; including design, implementation, debugging, as well as many miscellaneous tasks.

For discussions around the game and general support, I want to thank the Estate:Dominate discord, especially Heniss, for his thorough testing, detailed feedback, and his willingness to entertain my recurrent futile projects.
